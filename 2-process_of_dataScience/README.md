# Data Science Learning Journey

## Welcome to My Repository!
This repository is my personal space to document and save my learning journey in data science. As I dive into this field, I’m excited to explore the **systematic process of extracting insights from data** and building **data-driven solutions** for real-world challenges. Whether you’re here to track my progress or learn alongside me, I hope this repo offers something valuable!

### Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to:
- Record my growth as I master data science concepts, tools, and techniques.
- Store my notes, projects, and resources from this journey.
- Share how I’m learning to turn raw data into actionable insights.

## Introduction to Data Science
Data science is a **systematic process** that transforms questions into answers using data. It starts with **problem formulation**—defining a business or research question—then moves through steps like collecting data, cleaning it, and building models to uncover patterns. My goal is to understand how this process delivers solutions that matter. For more details, see my [Introduction Notes](introduction-to-data-science.md)!

## Topics Covered
Here’s an overview of the data science topics I’m exploring in this repo:

### 1. Process of Data Science
Today, we’ll discuss the **data science process in detail**, step by step, as I learn how it works. This is based on my notes from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxVjrrLhgng&t=1s). Below are the **key stages** I’m studying:

#### Key Stages
1. **Problem Formulation**  
   - Define the business or research question to solve.  
   - *Example*: "Can we predict which customers will stop using our service?"  
   - Sets the foundation for everything that follows.

2. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Collect data relevant to the problem identified in problem formulation.  
   - *Sources*: Databases, APIs, web scraping, surveys, etc.  
   - Focus: Get the right data to answer the question.

3. **Data Preparation**  
   - Prepare data for analysis through two main steps:  
     1. **Understanding Your Data**: Explore its structure, types, and quality.  
     2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data to make it usable.  
   - *Preprocessing Details*:  
     - Fix missing values, remove duplicates, standardize formats.  
     - *Impact*: Clean data improves model accuracy and reliability.

4. **Data Analysis**  
   - Analyze data to find patterns and build solutions.  
   - Techniques:  
     - Regression (predict numbers), Classification (predict categories), Clustering (group data), Statistical Models.  
   - Process:  
     1. Train models with data.  
     2. Evaluate models to find the top performer.  
     3. Deploy the best model for real-world use.

5. **Communication & Visualization**  
   - Share insights with stakeholders effectively.  
   - Tools: Plots (e.g., Matplotlib), Power BI, Tableau.  
   - *Importance*: Visualization makes complex data easy to understand and actionable.

### 2. Data Acquisition & Preparation  
   - Gathering data and cleaning it—making sense of the mess!

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Finding trends and relationships with stats and visuals.

### 4. Statistical Foundations  
   - Mastering the math behind data science (e.g., probability, regression).

### 5. Machine Learning Basics  
   - Building predictive models—my first steps with algorithms.

### 6. Model Deployment  
   - Taking models from theory to real-world use.

### 7. Visualization & Communication  
   - Turning insights into stories with charts and reports.

*(More topics will be added as I learn!)*

## My Learning Goals
- Get comfortable with tools like Python, R, and SQL.
- Create projects that tackle real problems.
- Connect every step—from **problem formulation** to **insight communication**—in the data science workflow.
