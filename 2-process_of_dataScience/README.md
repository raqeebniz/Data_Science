# Data Science Learning Journey

## Topics Covered
### 1. Process of Data Science
Today, we’ll discuss the **data science process in detail**, breaking it down into key stages. These notes are based on my learning from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxVjrrLhgng&t=1s).

#### Key Stages
1. **Problem Formulation**  
   - Define the business or research question.  
   - *Example*: "Can we predict customer churn?"  
   - Sets the goal for the entire process.

2. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Collect data tied to the problem.  
   - *Sources*: Databases, APIs, surveys, web scraping.  
   - Focus: Get relevant data to answer the question.

3. **Data Preparation**  
   - Get data ready for analysis in two steps:  
     1. **Understanding Your Data**: Check its structure, types, and quality.  
     2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
        - Clean data (fix missing values, remove duplicates).  
        - *Impact*: Improves model accuracy and reliability.

4. **Data Analysis**  
   - Find patterns and build solutions.  
   - Techniques:  
     - Regression (predict numbers).  
     - Classification (predict categories).  
     - Clustering (group data).  
     - Statistical models.  
   - Steps:  
     1. Train models with data.  
     2. Evaluate to pick the top model.  
     3. Deploy the best model.

5. **Communication & Visualization**  
   - Share insights with stakeholders.  
   - Tools: Plots (e.g., Matplotlib), Power BI, Tableau.  
   - *Importance*: Makes data easy to understand and actionable.

### 2. Data Acquisition & Preparation  
   - Gathering data and cleaning it—making sense of the mess!

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Finding trends and relationships with stats and visuals.

### 4. Statistical Foundations  
   - Mastering the math behind data science (e.g., probability, regression).

### 5. Machine Learning Basics  
   - Building predictive models—my first steps with algorithms.

### 6. Model Deployment  
   - Taking models from theory to real-world use.

### 7. Visualization & Communication  
   - Turning insights into stories with charts and reports.

## My Learning Goals
- Get comfortable with tools like Python, R, and SQL.
- Create projects that tackle real problems.
- Connect every step—from **problem formulation** to **insight communication**—in the data science workflow.

## How to Navigate This Repo
- **Notes**: Check out my detailed write-ups in topic-specific files (e.g., `process_of_dataScience/readme.md`).
- **Projects**: Look for hands-on work in the `projects/` directory (coming soon!).
- **Resources**: Find tools and references I’m using in the `resources/` folder.
