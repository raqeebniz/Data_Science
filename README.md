# Data Science Learning Journey

## Welcome to My Repository!
This repository is my personal space to document and save my learning journey in data science. As I dive into this field, I’m excited to explore the **systematic process of extracting insights from data** and building **data-driven solutions** for real-world challenges. Whether you’re here to track my progress or learn alongside me, I hope this repo offers something valuable!

### Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to:
- Record my growth as I master data science concepts, tools, and techniques.
- Store my notes, projects, and resources from this journey.
- Share how I’m learning to turn raw data into actionable insights.

## Introduction to Data Science
Data science is a **systematic process** that transforms questions into answers using data. It starts with **problem formulation**—defining a business or research question—then moves through steps like collecting data, cleaning it, and building models to uncover patterns. My goal is to understand how this process delivers solutions that matter. For more details, see my [Introduction Notes](introduction-to-data-science.md)!

## Topics Covered
Here’s an overview of the data science topics I’m exploring in this repo:

1. **Data Acquisition & Preparation**  
   - Gathering data and cleaning it—making sense of the mess!

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Finding trends and relationships with stats and visuals.

3. **Statistical Foundations**  
   - Mastering the math behind data science (e.g., probability, regression).

4. **Machine Learning Basics**  
   - Building predictive models—my first steps with algorithms.

5. **Model Deployment**  
   - Taking models from theory to real-world use.

6. **Visualization & Communication**  
   - Turning insights into stories with charts and reports.

*(More topics will be added as I learn!)*

## My Learning Goals
- Get comfortable with tools like Python, R, and SQL.
- Create projects that tackle real problems.
- Connect every step—from **problem formulation** to **insight communication**—in the data science workflow.

## How to Navigate This Repo
- **Notes**: Check out my detailed write-ups in topic-specific files (e.g., `introduction-to-data-science.md`).
- **Projects**: Look for hands-on work in the `projects/` directory (coming soon!).
- **Resources**: Find tools and references I’m using in the `resources/` folder.
